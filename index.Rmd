### Our aim is to understand human behavior and socio-technical phenomena in the digital society

---

## *Computational* in Computational Social Science
It can have three meanings:

- **Digital**<br> 
Based on large datasets of human behavior, for example produced by the Web and social media

- **Computerized**<br>
The quantitative analysis of data in an automated, tractable, repeatable, and extensible fashion

- **Generative**<br>
Application of data and results to design of agent-based models that explain complex social phenomena and motivate interventions

---


## Strengths and weaknesses of digital trace data

**Strengths:**
- Complementary approach to traditional survey and experimental methods
- Unprecedented scales and granularities
- Ease of data access, replicability of results
- Potentially high external validity, behavior in vivo

**Weaknesses:**
- Limits to internal validity: Lack of counterfactuals hinders causal analysis
- Self-selection bias: Who talks? Normalization issues: Who is silent?
- Data gatekeepers, Twitter as a model organism
- Intractability of black-box predictions and data piñatas

Emotional states shared by a large amount of people at the same time

## Conclusions

- Terrorist attacks trigger collective emotions that we can observe online

- Terms related to social resilience increase after collective emotions

- Individuals expressing stronger emotions used on average more terms related to social processes, prosocial behavior, and shared values

- Collective emotions are not just venting, they can keep us together

- Negative effects: inter-group conflict, intolerance, short-term orientation...

## EAT-Lancet and yes2meat: Summary

- We mapped the digital backlash to EAT-Lancet on Twitter through #yes2meat
- Birth of #yes2meat preceded the release of the report
- Four communities: pro-EAT-Lancet, skeptic, pro-yes2meat, and vegan
- Information flow from pro-yes2meat to skeptic community after report
- Diet polarization: liberal vegan vs conservative keto

**EATLancet vs yes2meat: the digital backlash to the planetary health diet.**

- Programmatic Interface to automate marketing campaign in Facebook
- Audiences can be tuned by demographic attributes (gender, age, income...) or interests (sports, political parties, entertainment...) 
- Accessible for everyone with a Facebook account - audience metrics for everyone
- Used in demographics and development research (e.g. [Zagheni, Weber, & Gummadi, 2017;](https://doi.org/10.1111/padr.12102) [Mejova et al., 2018;](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3209811.3212698) [Fatehkia, Kashyap, & Weber, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X18300883))

## The Facebook Gender Divide 

$R_{g,c}$: Ratio of Facebook active users of gender *g* over all inhabitants of gender *g* in country *c*

<center>

Facebook Gender Divide for country c:  
<br>$$FGD_c= log\left(\frac{R_{Male,c}}{R_{Female_c}}\right)$$</center>

Validation with survey data:
- FGD (217 countries)
- Global Web Index (34 countries)
- Pew Internet research (19 countries)

## The FGD and offline gender inequality

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=1100, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/FGDreg.jpg")
```
- Regression of FGD rank on WEF gender indices and controls
- Most explanatory variable: Education Gender Equality
---


## The Facebook Gender Divide: Summary

- Measure of gender divide with FB data comparable to surveys
- This measure captures offline gender equality indices across countries
- Temporal correlation between FGD and changes in economic gender eq.
- Superlinear scaling of FB activity with penetration: positive externality

Social media might also work as a *digital provide*. Is Facebook helping women to find employment in countries with high gender inequality?

## The Problem of Shadow Profiles

**Facebook Shadow Profile:**  
A file that Facebook keeps on you containing data it pulls from looking at the information that your friends voluntarily provide. [*(Digital Trends, 2013)*](https://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/what-exactly-is-a-facebook-shadow-profile/)

- 2011: Europe-vs-Facebook files complaint on shadow profiles

- 2013: Bug reveals private information of 6 million users

- Some users notice their shadow profiles with mobile numbers

- Apr 2014: 1B users of Facebook for mobile share  contact lists

- Aug 2016: Whatsapp and Facebook share information

Not a problem unique to Facebook: also in Twitter, Google, Amazon...

---

## Auditing Shadow Profiles

**Shadow profile hypothesis:**
The data shared by the users of an online platform predicts of personal information of non-users

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=600, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/shadowidea.png")
```
**Approach:** historical audit to evaluate how social networking sites could have predicted information of individuals who were not users yet

## Twitter shadow profile test

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=1100, fig.align='center'}

- Data represents a bidirectional social network
- Joined date of users shows network growth
- Tweet metadata contains posting app: disclosing users are only those who post at least once from Twitter mobile apps (shared contact lists)
- Predicting location of users who didn't join yet based on disclosing friends already on Twitter
---

## Location prediction and heterogeneity

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=1000, fig.align='center'}

- Location prediction of non-users greatly outperforms null model
- Individuals with more alters sharing contact lists in Twitter have lower error
